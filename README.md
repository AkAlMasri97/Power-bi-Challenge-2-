## Challenge 2 - Customer Insight
You are an analyst working closely with the customer team.

The customer engagement manager (Janet) has just returned from a meeting and has been given two data sets. One contains customer sales information and the other customer engagement information.

Janet is now looking for you to produce a report that looks at both data sets and gives us some insight into customer behaviour.

She is not sure if there is a correlation between sales and engagement but would like to know either way.

There is 1 years worth of data taken from both systems.

The ball is now in your court and you need to find a way presenting this data back to Janet and the team.
